## Installation

<to be update>

## Version

This repo contains the updated version of the software,copied from Raspberry Pi Weather Station, re-engineered for the [Stretch version of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/). If you are an existing Weather Station owner and are using a Pi running the Jessie version of Raspbian, then this code will not work without modification. You should flash your SD card with the [latest Raspbian image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and perform a fresh install of this software (you may wish to take a copy of your local MYSQL database first).
